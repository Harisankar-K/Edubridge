# COVID 19 Analysis:

The Covid-19 disease has shaken the world. It has spread far and wide across the globe leaving no one safe. While most countries have come to a standstill, a lot of healthcase groups, medical professionals, researchers and various other communities are fighting hard to overcome these hard times.

WHO declared Covid-19 a pandemic and India is fighting back by invoking the Epidemic Diseases Act in March, 2020: https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/trends/coronavirus-outbreak-india-italy-iran-china-total-confirmed-cases/story/397950.html

There are plenty of analysis, dashboards, insights, models, forecasts that have been shared by the community and we are very grateful to all the organzations that collect and share data publicly to facilitate these reports.
