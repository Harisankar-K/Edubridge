# EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) Using the Vaciination Data:

In data mining, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. EDA is used for seeing what the data can tell us before the modeling task. It is not easy to look at a column of numbers or a whole spreadsheet and determine important characteristics of the data. It may be tedious, boring, and/or overwhelming to derive insights by looking at plain numbers. Exploratory data analysis techniques have been devised as an aid in this situation.
in this we try to analyse the data to find  which state have more active cases more deaths and vaccination doses taken by each state etc.i hope you all can learn more clearly with this EDA and some part of visualisation helps more to understand about the vaccination drive.
